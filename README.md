# AlmaBetter-Capstone-Project-1
In this repository I have attached the documentation, code notebooks for the capstone project 1 
The project is about the EDA on Play Store app data. On analysing the data I have come up with the following conclusions,

# **Conclusion:**

The play store app market has diverse variety of apps present in it around 33 of them present in our dataset. In our analysis we identified some key insights that a developer can take advantage of. Here I am summing up our analysis in the following key insights.

1. 92.6% apps in the playstore are available for free of charge. Developers who develop free apps use google ads to generate revenue. While 7.4% apps are paid apps. So we can conclude that android app market is hugely dominated by the free apps. 
2. In the given dataset the average rating of more than 8000 apps is at the average of 4.2 with excellent rating. It is an indication that overall user satisfaction in the playstore app market is very good.
3. Also, we can see that 80% of the apps are meant for everyone irrespective of their age group. So, it is advisable to tap into this space which has large user base.
4. In the paid app market, 0.99\$ to 2.99\$ is accepted well, So anyone trying to launch a paid app can pick a price in this range.
5. Family and Gaming categories are performing well in the android market with highest installs in numbers.
6. Tech giants like Facebook and Google hold the top position when it comes to the number of installs. One must keep a note that many of the google apps are comes with the native android smartphone so there is no exaggeration that these apps have high installs. On the other hand Facebook being a social media platform disrupted the android market with Instagram, Whatsapp in its family. These popular apps though available for free but make huge money by running targetted ads.
7. Minecraft managed to get lots of users even being a paid app. Developers should learn the facts that made minecraft successful.
8. We can see from the User reviews dataset that 22% of the overall reviews are negative.
9. Paid app market is highly influenced by the user reviews as we have seen 87% correlation between reviews and Installs and 90% correlation between reviews and Estimated revenue.

So, to conclude developers can start building games or apps that families can enjoy to witness more audience. The social media app market is quite highly dominated by giant platforms and it is relatively hard to succeed in that space. Also while building paid apps, developers should reach the expectations and get good user reviews which significantly influence the app's reach and revenue.
